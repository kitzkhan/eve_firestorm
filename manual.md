# Firestorm - Game Manual

## 1. Introduction

**Firestorm** is a competitive card game where each player customizes and equips a unique starship, using creativity to build strategies and tailored decks. The game offers a dynamic deck-building experience, where your choice of modules and deck composition determines your play style and the evolution of every battle.

---

## 2. Game Components

* **Module Cards**: Special cards that can be installed on the ship, defining the abilities and resources available to the player.
* **Action Cards**: Cards generated by installed modules, used within decks to trigger actions, attacks, defenses, or special effects.
* **Ship Template**: Each player has a customizable ship with dedicated slots for module installation.
* **Ammo Tokens**: Tokens Representing Ammo stored or used in weapon modules

---

## 3. Ship Customization and Decks

### 3.1. Types of Module Slots

Each ship features four thematic categories of module slots, shaping the player's strategy and deck-building options:

* **Weapons Bays**: Attack modules (Cannons, Lasers, Missiles) that enable aggressive actions and high-impact strikes against opponents.
* **Defense Conduits**: Defense modules (Shield Generators, Armor Plates) designed to reinforce the ship's resilience and protect against incoming attacks.
* **Utility Rails**: Control and utility modules (Speed Modifiers, Warp Disruptors) that offer tactical flexibility and field manipulation capabilities.
* **Core Systems**: Support modules (Power Units, System Processors) providing passive bonuses and synergies, enhancing the overall performance and efficiency of the ship.

Each slot category allows installation of specific modules, directly influencing the types of action cards generated for the deck and the strategic approach available to the player.

### 3.2. Deck Generation and Structure

The installed modules in each slot generate a set of **Action Cards**, resulting in four distinct decks (one for each slot category).

#### Deck Identity and Color Coding

Each Deck corresponds to a slot category and is color-coded for quick identification:

* **Weapons Deck**: **Red Cards** (Aggression/Damage)
* **Defense Deck**: **Blue Cards** (Protection/Repair)
* **Utility Deck**: **Yellow Cards** (Control/E-War)
* **Core Systems Deck**: **Grey Cards** (Support/Passive)

#### Filler Card Mechanics (Acquire Target/Reload)

To simulate weapon cadence, certain slow or heavy modules generate **Filler Cards** (like "Acquire Target" or "Reload").

* **Function:** A Filler Card has an EP cost (e.g., 5 EP) but a minimal or zero immediate effect (e.g., "Discard this card").
* **Purpose:** Their primary role is to consume **EP** and occupy a space in the hand, forcing the player to spend a turn or resources to clear their hand to allow for a larger draw next turn.
* **Reload Example:** A Filler Card like "Reload Missiles" might have a small effect, such as, "Cost: 10 EP. Effect: Place 1 Missile Munitions Token from your Hangar."

### 3.3: Module Structure & Fitting Requirements

Modules are defined by both their resource cost (paid once during setup) and the permanent attributes they grant to their generated cards.

| Module Attribute | Role | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Credit Cost** | Cost to purchase and install the Module. | Paid once during the initial setup/fitting phase. |
| **PG Cost** | Power Grid requirement. | Must be met by the ship's available PG storage. |
| **CPU Cost** | Processing Unit requirement. | Must be met by the ship's available CPU capacity. |
| **Inherent Damage Type** | Fixed or based on ammo type. | Used for **Fixed Damage Modules** (e.g., Laser). Or based on ammo type  |
| **Initial Ammo Supply** | Tokens included with purchase. | **Multi-Phase Modules** typically include only the base **1x Kinetic Token**. |

#### Attribute Separation Summary (Final)

The following attributes are *permanently* tied to the Module and inherited by the Action Cards: **Impact Timing** and **Accuracy Factor**.

## 4. Game Setup

1.  **Choose Your Ship:** Each player selects a ship template, with available slots for module installation.
2.  **Install Modules:** Players choose suitable modules for each slot category, ensuring the ship's **PG** and **CPU** limits are respected.
3.  **Deck Preparation:** Modules generate their corresponding Action/Filler Cards, forming the four specialized decks.
4.  **Verification:** Both players verify the opposing ship's Modules (Module Cards are placed in the ship's slots) and Deck composition.
5.  **Shuffle and Initial Draw (Base Draw):** Each of the four Decks is shuffled individually. The active player draws **one card** from the deck corresponding to **each installed Module**.
    * *Example (Frontier Frigate):* If the player has 1 Utility Module, 1 Core Systems module and 2 Weapon Modules, they draw 1 Utility Card and 2 Weapon Cards, plus 1 card for the Core System (total 4 cards for the base setup).

#### 4.1. Initial Economy & Purchasing Phase

Before Deck Generation, players utilize a starting budget of **Credits** to customize their ship and initial resources.

1.  **Purchase Ship Template:** Pay the required Credit cost for the selected Ship Template.
2.  **Purchase Modules:** Pay the required **Credit Cost** for all desired Modules. Installed Modules must satisfy the ship's **PG** and **CPU** limits.
3.  **Purchase Optional Ammunition:** Players may purchase additional **Ammo Tokens** (Energy, Explosive, Disruptor) for any **Multi-Phase Modules** at a set Credit cost per token. Purchased tokens are stored in the **Hangar**.

## 5. Turn Flow: Firestorm Game Mechanics

The game proceeds in turns, following these four structured phases:

### 5.1. Phase 1: Regeneration Phase

The active player's ship gains **Energy (EP)** and **Shield** points according to its printed Regeneration rate.

* *Note: EP cannot exceed the ship's maximum Power Storage. Shield points cannot exceed the ship's maximum Shield Array value.*

### 5.2. Phase 2: Draw Phase (Replenishing Hand)

1.  The active player selects **one single Slot Category** to **Activate** for the turn (e.g., Weapons Bays).
2.  **Card Draw:** The player draws additional cards from the **Activated Deck** until the number of cards in their hand *from that specific Deck* equals the **number of fitted Modules** in that slot type **plus one (+1)**.
    * *Example:* If the player has 2 Weapons Modules and 1 Weapons Card remaining, they draw $3 - 1 = 2$ additional cards.
3.  **Maximum Play Limit:** For the next **Action Phase**, the player may play a maximum of only the **number of fitted Modules** from the cards drawn/held from the Activated Deck (e.g., max 2 Weapons Cards).

### 5.3. Phase 3: Action Phase (Playing Cards)

1.  The active player plays **Action Cards** and **Filler Cards** from their current hand by paying the required **EP Cost** for each card.
2.  Cards played are immediately resolved (effects, damage, etc., are applied).
3.  **Crucial Rule:** Any cards remaining in the player's hand at the end of this phase **are kept** for the next turn.

### 5.4. Phase 4: Cleanup Phase (End of Turn)

1.  Resolve any card effects that trigger "at the end of the turn."
2.  The turn ends, and play passes to the opposing player.

## 6. Combat Mechanics (Simplified Resistance)

### 6.1. Accuracy and Evasion

Accuracy is determined by a comparative dice roll, influenced by **Speed** and **Target Signature**.

#### Hull Size: Target Signature

The ship's size influences the difficulty of hitting it:

* **Small Ships (Frigate Class):** **Target Signature** of **-1** (penalty to Attacker's roll).
* **Large Ships (Cruiser/Battleship Class):** **Target Signature** of **+1** or **+2** (bonus to Attacker's roll).

#### Hit Chance Calculation

$$\text{Roll} (\text{Attack Score}) \geq \text{Roll} (\text{Defense Evasion})$$

1.  **Attack Score:** Attacker rolls **1D6** $\boldsymbol{+}$ Card's **Accuracy Factor** $\boldsymbol{+}$ Defender's **Target Signature**.
2.  **Defense Evasion:** Defender rolls **1D6** $\boldsymbol{+}$ Defender's **Speed** value.

| Verdict | Condition | Damage Multiplier |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical Hit** | Attack Score $\boldsymbol{\ge}$ Defense Evasion $\boldsymbol{+ 2}$ | $\+5$  |
| **Successful Hit** | Attack Score $\boldsymbol{>}$ Defense Evasion | $\times 1$ |
| **Glancing Hit** | Attack Score $\boldsymbol{=}$ Defense Evasion | $\times 0.5$ (**Round Down**) |
| **Miss** | Attack Score $\boldsymbol{<}$ Defense Evasion | $\times 0$ |

### 6.2. Damage Application

#### Impact Timing

Damage is applied based on the card's **Impact Timing**:

* **Instant:** Damage is applied immediately in the current **Action Phase**.
* **Next Turn:** Damage is applied at the start of the attacker's **Cleanup Phase** of the *next* turn. The card is placed in the **Pending Damage Zone** with a **Tracking Token**.

#### Variable Damage Formula

Damage calculation is performed in two simple steps:

1.  **Base Damage:** Calculate the damage total using the Hit Type Multiplier (e.g., Critical Hit: $\times 1.5$):
    $$\text{Damage Base} = (\text{Damage Base Value} + \text{Roll}(\text{Damage Dice})) \times \text{Multiplier}$$
2.  **Final Damage (Resistance Check):** Apply the absolute modifier based on the layer hit.

#### Damage Types and Absolute Resistance

Damage is applied to the top defensive layer (**Shields** $\rightarrow$ **Armor** $\rightarrow$ **Hull**). If the layer hit is Vulnerable or Resistant to the damage type, a simple $\mathbf{+2}$ or $\mathbf{-2}$ is applied to the calculated Base Damage.

| Layer Hit | Kinetic | Energy | Explosive | Disruptor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shields** | Resistance ($\mathbf{-2}$) | **Vulnerability ($\mathbf{+2}$)** | Neutral ($\mathbf{0}$) | Neutral ($\mathbf{0}$) |
| **Armor** | **Vulnerability ($\mathbf{+2}$)** | Resistance ($\mathbf{-2}$) | Neutral ($\mathbf{0}$) | Neutral ($\mathbf{0}$) |
| **Hull** | Neutral ($\mathbf{0}$) | Neutral ($\mathbf{0}$) | **Vulnerability ($\mathbf{+2}$)** | Resistance ($\mathbf{-2}$) |

***

### Example: Simplified Damage Calculation

**Scenario:** The Frontier Frigate (No Shields) is hit by a **Successful Hit** carrying **10 Base Damage** of type **Kinetic**.

1.  **Base Damage:** $10$ (Since it was a Successful Hit, Multiplier is $\times 1$).
2.  **Layer Hit:** Damage proceeds to **Armor** (Plating).
3.  **Resistance Check:** Armor is **Vulnerable** to Kinetic ($\mathbf{+2}$).
4.  **Final Damage Applied:** $10 + 2 = \mathbf{12 \text{ Damage}}$.

### 6.3. Dynamic Munitions System (Multi-Phase Modules)

This system governs weapons that can change their damage type, utilizing the **Active Ammo Token** mechanic.

* **Active Ammo Token:** This token, placed on the Module Card, dictates the **Damage Type** used by all corresponding Action Cards played (e.g., "Controlled Shot").
* **Hangar:** Used to store all purchased, available, but currently inactive Ammo Tokens.
* **Depleted Pool:** Used to store tokens that have been cycled out.

##### The "Munitions Swap" Action

The **"Munitions Swap"** Action Card facilitates strategic change and triggers the depletion rule:

1.  **Effect:** The player may select one token from their **Hangar** (if available) and move it to the Module's Active Ammo Slot.
2.  **Depletion:** The token that was previously **Active** is immediately moved to the **Depleted Pool**.

Tokens in the **Depleted Pool** are unavailable.

## 7 Full Combat Turn Example: Applying New Rules

This scenario simulates a complete **Action Phase** for Player 1, including hand management and a detailed attack resolution using the simplified mechanics.

### 7.1 Initial State

**Attacking Ship (Player 1): Frontier Frigate Line**
* **Key Stats:** Speed: 2. Target Signature: **-1** (Small Ship). Energy (EP) Remaining: 50.
* **Modules Equipped:** 2 Weapons Bays, 1 Utility Rail, 1 Core System.
* **Cards Played:** **Two** Weapons Cards ("Projectile Burst" and "Positioning Shot" - the filler card).
    * **"Projectile Burst" Card:** Damage Type: **Kinetic**. EP Cost: 3. Accuracy Factor: +3. Damage Base: 4. Damage Dice: 1D6.

**Defending Ship (Player 2): Hypothetical Frigate**
* **Key Stats:** Speed: 1. Target Signature: -1.
* **Defense:** Has **Armor (Plating)**, No Shields.

---

### 7.2 The Action Phase (Player 1)

Player 1 has activated their **Weapons Deck** and has drawn their maximum limit of $2 + 1 = 3$ cards. Player 1 chooses to play two cards (the maximum allowed by their 2 **Weapons Bays**).

1.  **Action 1 (Filler Card):** Player 1 plays **"Positioning Shot"** (our new filler card from the slow weapon).
    * **Cost:** 3 EP. New EP: $50 - 3 = 47$ EP.
    * **Effect:** The card is placed in the **Graveyard**, successfully clearing a hand slot for the next turn's draw.

2.  **Action 2 (Attack Card):** Player 1 plays **"Projectile Burst"**.
    * **Cost:** 3 EP. New EP: $47 - 3 = 44$ EP.
    * **Resolution:** Combat sequence begins.

---

### 7.3 Combat Sequence (Attack Resolution)

#### Step A: Accuracy Check (Hit Chance)

| Calculation | Attacker (P1) | Defender (P2) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1D6 Roll** | Rolls **4** | Rolls **5** |
| **Accuracy / Speed Modifiers** | +3 (Accuracy Factor) | +1 (P2 Speed) |
| **Target Signature Modifier** | -1 (P2's Target Signature) | 0 (N/A) |
| **Final Score** | $4 + 3 + (-1) = \mathbf{6}$ | $5 + 1 = \mathbf{6}$ |

* **Verdict:** Attack Score (6) $\boldsymbol{=}$ Evasion Score (6).
* **Result:** **Glancing Hit**. Applies Damage Multiplier $\times 0.5$ (**Round Down**).

#### Step B: Base Damage Calculation

1.  **Damage Dice Roll (1D6):** Rolls **3**.
2.  **Bonus Effect Check:** The Accuracy Roll was **4** (not 6), so the **+3 Damage** bonus is **not applied**.
3.  **Gross Base Damage:** $4 (\text{Base}) + 3 (\text{Roll}) = \mathbf{7 \text{ Damage}}$.
4.  **Apply Glancing Hit Multiplier ($\times 0.5$):**
    * $7 \times 0.5 = 3.5$.
    * **Net Base Damage:** Rounded down to **3**.

#### Step C: Resistance Check (Absolute Modifier)

The Net Base Damage (3) is directed at the Defender's **Armor (Plating)**.

1.  **Layer Hit:** Armor.
2.  **Damage Type:** Kinetic.
3.  **Resistance Profile:** Armor is **Vulnerable** to Kinetic damage. Applies modifier $\mathbf{+2}$.
4.  **Total Final Damage:** $3 + 2 = \mathbf{5 \text{ Damage}}$.

#### Step D: Critical Hit Check

* **Verdict:** Glancing Hit.
* **Critical Bonus:** Not applied (The **+5 Damage** bonus applies only on a Critical Hit).

### 7.4 Final Damage Applied

The Defending Ship takes a total of **5 Damage**, which is subtracted from its **Armor** value.

---
This turn successfully demonstrated how the player must spend EP to manage their hand and how the simplified resistance rules are applied for fast, tactical damage resolution.
