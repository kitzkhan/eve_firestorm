# Firestorm - Game Manual

## 1. Introduction

Firestorm is a competitive card game where each player customizes and equips a unique starship, using creativity to build strategies and tailored decks. The game offers a dynamic deck-building experience, where your choice of modules and deck composition determines your play style and the evolution of every battle.

## 2. Game Components

- **Module Cards**: Special cards that can be installed on the ship, defining the abilities and resources available to the player.
- **Action Cards**: Cards generated by installed modules, used within decks to trigger actions, attacks, defenses, or special effects.
- **Ship Template**: Each player has a customizable ship with dedicated slots for module installation.

## 3. Types of Module Slots

Each ship features 4 thematic categories of module slots, shaping the player’s strategy and deck-building options:

- **Weapons Bays**  
  Attack modules (Cannons, Lasers, Missiles) that enable aggressive actions and high-impact strikes against opponents.

- **Defense Conduits**  
  Defense modules (Shield Generators, Armor Plates) designed to reinforce the ship’s resilience and protect against incoming attacks.

- **Utility Rails**  
  Control and utility modules (Speed Modifiers, Warp Disruptors) that offer tactical flexibility and field manipulation capabilities.

- **Core Systems**  
  Support modules (Power Units, System Processors) providing passive bonuses and synergies, enhancing the overall performance and efficiency of the ship.

Each slot category allows installation of specific modules, directly influencing the types of action cards generated for the deck and the strategic approach available to the player.

## 4. Deck Building & Game Setup

1. **Choose Your Ship**  
   Each player selects a ship template, with available slots for module installation.

2. **Install Modules**  
   Players choose suitable modules for each slot category, setting the foundation for their strategy.

3. **Generate Decks**  
   The installed modules in each slot generate a set of action cards, resulting in four distinct decks (one for each slot category).

    A. Deck Structure and Visuals
    Specialized Decks: Each player begins the game with four distinct Decks generated as a result of the Modules chosen during ship construction.
    
    Deck Identity (Color Coding): Each Deck corresponds to a slot category and is color-coded for quick identification:
    
    **Weapons Deck**: Red Cards (Aggression/Damage)
    
    **Defense Deck**: Blue Cards (Protection/Repair)
    
    **Utility Deck**: Yellow Cards (Control/E-War)
    
    **Core Systems Deck**: Grey Cards (Support/Passive)
    
    B. Filler Card Mechanics (Acquire Target/Reload)
    To simulate weapon cadence, certain slow or heavy modules generate Filler Cards (like "Acquire Target" or "Reload").
    
    Function: A Filler Card has an EP cost (e.g., 5 EP) but a minimal or zero immediate effect (e.g., "Discard this card").
    
    Purpose: Their primary role is to consume EP and occupy a space in the hand, forcing the player to spend a turn or resources to clear their hand to allow for a larger draw next turn.
    
    Reload Example: A Filler Card like "Reload Missiles" might have a small effect, such as, "Cost: 10 EP. Effect: Place 1 Missile Munitions Token in your Hangar."

4. **Game Setup (Start of Match)**
Module Verification: Both players verify the opposing ship's Modules (Module Cards are placed in the ship's slots) and Deck composition.

Deck Shuffle: Each of the four Decks is shuffled individually.

Initial Draw (Base Draw): The active player draws one card from the deck corresponding to each installed Module.

Example (Frontier Frigate): If the player has 1 Utility Module, 1 Core Systems module and 2 Weapon Modules, they draw 1 Utility Card and 2 Weapon Cards, plus 1 card for the Core System (total 4 cards for the base setup above).

## 5. Turn Flow: Firestorm Game Mechanics
The game proceeds in turns, following these four structured phases:

Phase 1: **Regeneration Phase** (Start of Turn)
  The active player's ship gains Energy (EP) and Shield points according to its printed Regeneration rate. 
  Note: EP cannot exceed the ship's maximum Power Storage. Shield points cannot exceed the ship's maximum Shield Array value.

Phase 2: **Draw Phase** (Replenishing Hand)

  The active player selects one single Slot Category to Activate for the turn (e.g., Weapons Bays).  
  Card Draw: The player draws additional cards from the Activated Deck until the number of cards in their hand from that specific Deck equals the number of fitted Modules in that slot type plus one (+1).
  Example (Frontier Frigate with 2 Weapons Modules): The player activates the Weapons Deck. The maximum number of Weapons Cards they can hold in their hand is 2+1=3. If they currently have 1 Weapons Card remaining, they draw 3−1=2 additional cards.
  Maximum Play Limit: For the Action Phase, the player may play a maximum of only the number of fitted Modules (in this case, 2 Weapons Cards) from the cards drawn/held from the Activated Deck.

Phase 3: **Action Phase** (Playing Cards)
  The active player plays Action Cards and Filler Cards from their current hand by paying the required EP Cost for each card.
  Cards played are immediately resolved (effects, damage, etc., are applied).
  Crucial Rule: Any cards remaining in the player's hand at the end of this phase are kept for the next turn.
Phase 4: **Cleanup Phase** (End of Turn)
  Resolve any card effects that trigger "at the end of the turn."
  The turn ends, and play passes to the opposing player.



## 6. Glossary

- **Deck Building**: The process of selecting modules and generating decks associated with each slot category.
- **Module Slot**: A space on the ship where a module is installed, determining the type of action cards available.
- **Deck**: A pack of action cards associated with a slot category, formed from the modules installed.

## 7. TODO

- Define concrete examples of modules and the types of action cards they generate
- Establish rules for starting a match and how decks are used
- Create ship templates with unique slots and abilities
- Develop the expansion system: introducing new ships, modules, and cards via expansions
- Detail scoring and victory mechanics
- Add illustrations, gameplay examples, and scenario walkthroughs
- Playtest and balance modules and decks for diverse playstyles
