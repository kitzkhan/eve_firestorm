# Firestorm - Game Manual

## 1. Introduction

Firestorm is a competitive card game where each player customizes and equips a unique starship, using creativity to build strategies and tailored decks. The game offers a dynamic deck-building experience, where your choice of modules and deck composition determines your play style and the evolution of every battle.

## 2. Game Components

- **Module Cards**: Special cards that can be installed on the ship, defining the abilities and resources available to the player.
- **Action Cards**: Cards generated by installed modules, used within decks to trigger actions, attacks, defenses, or special effects.
- **Ship Template**: Each player has a customizable ship with dedicated slots for module installation.

## 3. Types of Module Slots

Each ship features 4 thematic categories of module slots, shaping the player’s strategy and deck-building options:

- **Weapons Bays**  
  Attack modules (Cannons, Lasers, Missiles) that enable aggressive actions and high-impact strikes against opponents.

- **Defense Conduits**  
  Defense modules (Shield Generators, Armor Plates) designed to reinforce the ship’s resilience and protect against incoming attacks.

- **Utility Rails**  
  Control and utility modules (Speed Modifiers, Warp Disruptors) that offer tactical flexibility and field manipulation capabilities.

- **Core Systems**  
  Support modules (Power Units, System Processors) providing passive bonuses and synergies, enhancing the overall performance and efficiency of the ship.

Each slot category allows installation of specific modules, directly influencing the types of action cards generated for the deck and the strategic approach available to the player.

## 4. Deck Building & Game Setup

1. **Choose Your Ship**  
   Each player selects a ship template, with available slots for module installation.

2. **Install Modules**  
   Players choose suitable modules for each slot category, setting the foundation for their strategy.

3. **Generate Decks**  
   The installed modules in each slot generate a set of action cards, resulting in four distinct decks (one for each slot category).

    A. Deck Structure and Visuals
    Specialized Decks: Each player begins the game with four distinct Decks generated as a result of the Modules chosen during ship construction.
    
    Deck Identity (Color Coding): Each Deck corresponds to a slot category and is color-coded for quick identification:
    
    **Weapons Deck**: Red Cards (Aggression/Damage)
    
    **Defense Deck**: Blue Cards (Protection/Repair)
    
    **Utility Deck**: Yellow Cards (Control/E-War)
    
    **Core Systems Deck**: Grey Cards (Support/Passive)
    
    B. Filler Card Mechanics (Acquire Target/Reload)
    To simulate weapon cadence, certain slow or heavy modules generate Filler Cards (like "Acquire Target" or "Reload").
    
    Function: A Filler Card has an EP cost (e.g., 5 EP) but a minimal or zero immediate effect (e.g., "Discard this card").
    
    Purpose: Their primary role is to consume EP and occupy a space in the hand, forcing the player to spend a turn or resources to clear their hand to allow for a larger draw next turn.
    
    Reload Example: A Filler Card like "Reload Missiles" might have a small effect, such as, "Cost: 10 EP. Effect: Place 1 Missile Munitions Token in your Hangar."

4. **Game Setup (Start of Match)**
Module Verification: Both players verify the opposing ship's Modules (Module Cards are placed in the ship's slots) and Deck composition.

Deck Shuffle: Each of the four Decks is shuffled individually.

Initial Draw (Base Draw): The active player draws one card from the deck corresponding to each installed Module.

Example (Frontier Frigate): If the player has 1 Utility Module, 1 Core Systems module and 2 Weapon Modules, they draw 1 Utility Card and 2 Weapon Cards, plus 1 card for the Core System (total 4 cards for the base setup above).

---
## 5. Turn Flow: Firestorm Game Mechanics
The game proceeds in turns, following these four structured phases:

Phase 1: **Regeneration Phase** (Start of Turn)
  The active player's ship gains Energy (EP) and Shield points according to its printed Regeneration rate. 
  Note: EP cannot exceed the ship's maximum Power Storage. Shield points cannot exceed the ship's maximum Shield Array value.

Phase 2: **Draw Phase** (Replenishing Hand)

  The active player selects one single Slot Category to Activate for the turn (e.g., Weapons Bays).  
  Card Draw: The player draws additional cards from the Activated Deck until the number of cards in their hand from that specific Deck equals the number of fitted Modules in that slot type plus one (+1).
  Example (Frontier Frigate with 2 Weapons Modules): The player activates the Weapons Deck. The maximum number of Weapons Cards they can hold in their hand is 2+1=3. If they currently have 1 Weapons Card remaining, they draw 3−1=2 additional cards.
  Maximum Play Limit: For the Action Phase, the player may play a maximum of only the number of fitted Modules (in this case, 2 Weapons Cards) from the cards drawn/held from the Activated Deck.

Phase 3: **Action Phase** (Playing Cards)
  The active player plays Action Cards and Filler Cards from their current hand by paying the required EP Cost for each card.
  Cards played are immediately resolved (effects, damage, etc., are applied).
  Crucial Rule: Any cards remaining in the player's hand at the end of this phase are kept for the next turn.
  
Phase 4: **Cleanup Phase** (End of Turn)
  Resolve any card effects that trigger "at the end of the turn."
  The turn ends, and play passes to the opposing player.

### 6. Combat

## 1. Revised Core Combat Mechanics

We will introduce **Target Signature** (Hull Size) and finalize the **Impact Timing** rules.

### A. Hull Size: Target Signature

The size of the ship impacts both the attacker's accuracy and the defender's evasion.

* **Small Ships (Frigate Class):** Have a **Target Signature** of **-1**. This penalty is applied to the **Attacker's Accuracy Roll**, making the Frigate harder to hit.
* **Large Ships (Cruiser/Battleship Class):** Will have a **Target Signature** of **+1** or **+2**, making them easier targets.

### B. Mechanics: Accuracy and Evasion

Accuracy is now determined by the attack card's **Accuracy Factor** and the ship's **Target Signature**. Weapon size will be factored into the card's base **Accuracy Factor**.

$$\text{Roll} (\text{Attack Score}) \geq \text{Roll} (\text{Defense Evasion})$$

1.  **Attack Score:** Attacker rolls **1D6** $\boldsymbol{+}$ Card's **Accuracy Factor** $\boldsymbol{+}$ Defender's **Target Signature**.
2.  **Defense Evasion:** Defender rolls **1D6** $\boldsymbol{+}$ Defender's **Speed** value.
3.  **Verdict:**
    * **Critical Hit:** Attack Score $\boldsymbol{\ge}$ Defense Evasion $\boldsymbol{+ 2}$.
    * **Successful Hit:** Attack Score $\boldsymbol{>}$ Defense Evasion.
    * **Glancing Hit:** Attack Score $\boldsymbol{=}$ Defense Evasion. **Damage is halved** (rounded down).
    * **Miss:** Attack Score $\boldsymbol{<}$ Defense Evasion. **Damage is zero.**

### C. Mechanics: Impact Timing

Damage application is now determined by the **Impact Timing** value on the card.

* **Instant:** Damage is applied immediately in the current **Action Phase**. (Fast weapons like cannons).
* **Next Turn:** Damage is applied at the start of the **Cleanup Phase** of the attacker's *next* turn. (Slow ordnance like missiles/torpedoes).
    * **Tracking Token:** When a 'Next Turn' card is played, it is placed face-up in a designated **Pending Damage Zone** on the Ship Template, and a **Tracking Token** is placed on it. It remains there until the damage is resolved.

### D. Mechanics: Variable Damage

Damage calculation is now finalized, integrating the hit type:

$$\text{Damage Applied} = (\text{Damage Base} + \text{Roll}(\text{Damage Dice})) \times \text{Damage Multiplier}$$

| Hit Type | Damage Multiplier |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Critical Hit** | $\boldsymbol{\times 1.5}$ (Round up) |
| **Successful Hit** | $\times 1$ |
| **Glancing Hit** | $\times 0.5$ (Round down) |
| **Miss** | $\times 0$ |

---

## 2. Updated Example: "Projectile Burst" Attack

We will apply the new mechanics to the **Projectile Burst Cannon** and adjust its bonus effect to a damage increase. (Since the **Frontier Frigate** is a Frigate, its **Target Signature** is **-1**).

### Card: "Projectile Burst" (Action Card)

| Attribute | Value | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Color/Deck** | **Red** (Weapons Deck) | |
| **EP Cost** | 3 EP | |
| **Accuracy Factor** | **+3** | Adjusted for small, high-accuracy weapon. |
| **Damage Base** | 4 | |
| **Damage Dice** | **1D6** | |
| **Impact Timing** | **Instant** | Damage applies now. |
| **Bonus Effect** | If the **1D6** Accuracy Roll is a **6**, add $\boldsymbol{+3}$ to the total calculated damage. |

### Detailed Attack Resolution Example

**Scenario:**
* **Attacker (P1):** Frontier Frigate (Speed 2, Target Signature -1). Plays "Projectile Burst."
* **Defender (P2):** Hypothetical Frigate (Speed 1, Target Signature -1).

#### 1. Attack Score Calculation:

* **Attacker Roll (1D6):** Rolls **4**.
* **Score:** $4 (\text{Roll}) + 3 (\text{Accuracy Factor}) + (-1) (\text{Defender's Signature}) = \mathbf{6}$.

#### 2. Evasion Score Calculation:

* **Defender Roll (1D6):** Rolls **5**.
* **Score:** $5 (\text{Roll}) + 1 (\text{Defender's Speed}) = \mathbf{6}$.

#### 3. Verdict:

* Attack Score ($\mathbf{6}$) $\boldsymbol{=}$ Defense Evasion ($\mathbf{6}$).
* **Result:** **Glancing Hit**. Damage is halved.

#### 4. Damage Calculation:

* **Damage Dice Roll (1D6):** Rolls **3**.
* **Base Damage:** $4 (\text{Base}) + 3 (\text{Roll}) = 7$.
* **Damage Multiplier:** $\times 0.5$ (Glancing Hit).
* **Total Damage:** $7 \times 0.5 = 3.5$. Rounded down to $\mathbf{3}$.

This new framework is robust, highly tactical, and integrates all the core concepts (EP, Filler, Accuracy, Hull Size, Speed, and Dice Rolls) into every single attack action.

What part of this combat model would you like to refine next?

### 7. Applying Damage
## 1. Introducing Damage Types

We will use four core damage types, each designed to excel against a specific defensive layer or to carry a unique side effect.

| Damage Type | Primary Effect / Description | Best Against |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kinetic** | Standard physical impact damage (projectiles, cannons). High damage; often blocked by shields. | **Armor** (Penetrates Shields poorly) |
| **Energy** | Directed energy (lasers, beams). Excels at overloading energy systems. | **Shields** (Minimal effect on Armor/Hull) |
| **Explosive** | Area-of-effect damage (missiles, torpedoes). High splash damage. | **Hull** (Often bypasses some Armor) |
| **Disruptor** | Electronic/System damage. Low direct damage, high utility effects. | **Systems/EP** (Causes system failures) |

---

## 2. Damage Resistance Mechanics

Each layer of the ship's defense (**Shield, Armor, Hull**) will now have a **Vulnerability** and a **Resistance** factor to these damage types. This is represented by a multiplier.

* **Standard Rule:** If a ship has a specific defensive layer (e.g., Shield), damage is applied to that layer first.
* **Vulnerability ($\times 1.25$):** Multiplies the total damage of that specific type by $1.25$ (rounded up).
* **Resistance ($\times 0.75$):** Multiplies the total damage of that specific type by $0.75$ (rounded down).

### Defensive Layer Profile

| Layer | Kinetic | Energy | Explosive | Disruptor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shields** (If present) | Resistance ($\times 0.75$) | **Vulnerability ($\times 1.25$)** | Standard ($\times 1$) | Standard ($\times 1$) |
| **Armor** (Plating) | **Vulnerability ($\times 1.25$)** | Resistance ($\times 0.75$) | Standard ($\times 1$) | Standard ($\times 1$) |
| **Hull** (Structure) | Standard ($\times 1$) | Standard ($\times 1$) | **Vulnerability ($\times 1.25$)** | Resistance ($\times 0.75$) |

**Example Application:**
The **Frontier Frigate** (which has **no Shields**) is hit by **10** points of **Kinetic Damage**.
1.  Damage goes to **Armor** (Plating).
2.  Armor is **Vulnerable** to Kinetic ($\times 1.25$).
3.  Final Damage: $10 \times 1.25 = 12.5$. Rounded up to **13 Damage**.

---

## 3. Module Integration (Revisiting an Example)

The **Damage Type** must now be included on the action cards. We will update the **Projectile Burst Cannon** example.

### Updated Card: "Projectile Burst" (Action Card)

| Attribute | Value | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Damage Type** | **Kinetic** | Applies Kinetic Resistance/Vulnerability. |
| **Accuracy Factor** | $\mathbf{+3}$ | |
| **Damage Base** | 4 | |
| **Damage Dice** | **1D6** | |
| **Impact Timing** | **Instant** | |
| **Bonus Effect** | If the **1D6** Accuracy Roll is a 6, add $\boldsymbol{+3}$ to the total calculated damage. |

### Module Defenses (Defense Conduits)

Defense modules will grant specific bonuses or resistances that **stack** with the base ship defense. Since the Frontier Frigate has **0 Defense Conduits**, it cannot gain these bonuses, making it highly dependent on its base **Armor**. Other ship templates (like the Sentinel) could mount modules that specifically grant $\times 0.5$ resistance against **Explosive** damage, for example, compensating for the Hull's vulnerability.

This system forces players to diversify their weapon decks and ensures that mounting modules (or lacking them, in the Frigate's case) directly dictates the ship's tactical weaknesses.

Does this system of damage types and resistances meet your expectations for strategic depth?
