# Firestorm - Game Manual

## 1. Introduction

Firestorm is a competitive card game where each player customizes and equips a unique starship, using creativity to build strategies and tailored decks. The game offers a dynamic deck-building experience, where your choice of modules and deck composition determines your play style and the evolution of every battle.

## 2. Game Components

- **Module Cards**: Special cards that can be installed on the ship, defining the abilities and resources available to the player.
- **Action Cards**: Cards generated by installed modules, used within decks to trigger actions, attacks, defenses, or special effects.
- **Ship Template**: Each player has a customizable ship with dedicated slots for module installation.

## 3. Types of Module Slots

Each ship features 4 thematic categories of module slots, shaping the player’s strategy and deck-building options:

- **Weapons Bays**  
  Attack modules (Cannons, Lasers, Missiles) that enable aggressive actions and high-impact strikes against opponents.

- **Defense Conduits**  
  Defense modules (Shield Generators, Armor Plates) designed to reinforce the ship’s resilience and protect against incoming attacks.

- **Utility Rails**  
  Control and utility modules (Speed Modifiers, Warp Disruptors) that offer tactical flexibility and field manipulation capabilities.

- **Core Systems**  
  Support modules (Power Units, System Processors) providing passive bonuses and synergies, enhancing the overall performance and efficiency of the ship.

Each slot category allows installation of specific modules, directly influencing the types of action cards generated for the deck and the strategic approach available to the player.

## 4. Deck Building & Game Setup

1. **Choose Your Ship**  
   Each player selects a ship template, with available slots for module installation.

2. **Install Modules**
