## MX-1 Modular Cannon (Small Ship Weapon)

This compact, efficient, and flexible cannon system is designed for small, fast ships, balancing rate of fire with multi-munition capability.

| Module Attribute | Value | Requirement/Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Credit Cost** | **1,000 Credits** | Low acquisition cost for light vessels. |
| **Slot Type** | **Weapons Bay** | |
| **PG Cost / CPU Cost** | $\mathbf{8} / \mathbf{6}$ | Low fitting requirements. |
| **Inherent Impact Timing** | **INSTANT** | All hits resolve immediately. |
| **Inherent Accuracy Factor** | $\mathbf{+2}$ | Base accuracy of the weapon system. |
| **Initial Ammo Supply** | **1x Kinetic Token (K)** | Token is **Active** at the start. |
| **Card Generation** | **4x MX-1 Impact Round, 2x MX-1 Payload Switch** | (6 total cards added to the Weapons Deck) |

### A. MX-1 Impact Round (4 Copies)

This is the standard attack card. It applies the **Complexity Factor** (positive value for an easy/quick shot) to the final **Attack Score**.

| Card Attribute | Value | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EP Cost** | 3 EP | |
| **Complexity Factor** | **+1** | **(Additive to Attack Score)**. Represents a quick, low-complexity firing solution. |
| **Damage Base** | 4 | |
| **Damage Dice** | **1D6** | |
| **Damage Type** | **Active Ammo Type** | Inherited from the Token on the Module. |
| **Effect** | Execute an attack. Deals damage based on the **Active Ammo Token** type. |

**Complexity Factor Logic:** This factor is added directly to your Accuracy Check  roll. A hard-to-execute card (e.g., a precise shot) would have a negative factor (e.g., **-1**).

### B. MX-1 Payload Switch (2 Copies)

This is the utility card that allows the player to tactically change the active munition, with an optional check to prevent unnecessary card usage.

| Card Attribute | Value | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EP Cost** | 2 EP | |
| **Impact Timing** | N/A | |
| **Effect** | **Optional Payload Switch:** You may choose to swap the active munition type **only if** you have at least one token available in your **Hangar**. If you choose to swap: Select one token from your **Hangar** and make it the **Active Ammo Token**. Move the token that was previously **Active** to the **Depleted Pool**. |
